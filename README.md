High-resolution imputed maps of spatial cell-type distributions can be used to study variations in cell-type density in relation to macroscale phenotypes. These maps can be utilized in studies focused on both the structure and function of the brain in health and disease, specifically within the context of neurological conditions including neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders.
